## How to run
This application requires Docker and Docker compose. Please install them first.
* [Docker installation](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Docker compose installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

To run the app, use the following command:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
When it is ready, visit [here](http://localhost:8080)

---

**Note**: If you run the app for the first time, the `server` container might stop, saying the database is not ready to be used. You can safely ignore the message because it only occurs when mounting the volume for `mySQL` and the `server` container will eventually run when the `mySQL` container is ready.

Flask server provides API to send a mail to the admin email account. React uses this API to implement the contact-us page. Firebase is responsible for authentication.
